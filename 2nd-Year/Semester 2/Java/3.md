## Classes
- Objects belong to classes

- A single computation may require many sub-computations

- Methods should act like black boxes

## Variables
- Will only live within duration of that code block

- Upper case type means object reference declaration. Lower case means primitives

- Wrapper classes encapsulate a primitive. Example: Integer

- Autoboxing calls the methods valueOf and intValue of Integer and other class implementaions of primitives
```java
Integer l = 52 // autobox
```
