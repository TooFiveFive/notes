## Sensors
### MICA mote architecture
- Uses an OS for sensors called TinyOS

- Consists of: Fram(state), tasks, command handlers and interupt handlers

- CPU has tasks that are put in queue. Context of every task is the frame.

- Task pointers mean that only one copy of a task can be in the queue

- HWClock can trigger a timer which triggers and event which causes side effects

- "Active Messages" implements a communication protocol in this case between the router and the radio transmitter
