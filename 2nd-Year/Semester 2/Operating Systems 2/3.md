## Process Scheduling in Parallel (Multi Core)

### Group Scheduling example
- Assume 2 cores directly connected to L2 cache

- Scheduler analyses the process execution pattern

- P1 uses computational power. P2 has many memory accesses. It may make sense to schedule these to be in the same package.

- If there's only one data bus going to main memory, then only one memory intensive process should be run at a time

- This takes into account the topology of a system.

## Scheduling domains
- A set of cores that share scheduling policies

- Domains are ways of partitioning up cores in order to create virtual configurations of computational power.

- Domains can be nested. So a 4 core CPU can have 2x2core domains, 1x4core domain and 4x1core domains.

### Policies
- Have a threshhold for when a core is under/over-loaded.
    - This can be used for load balancing as processes can be offloaded to other CPUs

- Power saving can be achieved by balancing the load across multiple cores

## Operation Modes
### Cluster Migration
- Designates clusters of cores that can be exclusively active at the same time.
