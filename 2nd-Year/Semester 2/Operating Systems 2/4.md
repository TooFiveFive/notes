## Process Scheduling
### Single Core
#### FIFO
- Processes run until designated deadline.

#### Group Scheduling
- Processes are grouped into a group that shares resources.

- They update their deadline in real time 

#### Priorities, multi-level feedback queues
- Each priority level is mapped to a time slice that increases by 10ms per level per say.

- When a process meets the deadline, it's put down to lowest level with entries.

- For fairness, the scheduler ignores the just run process and finds the next highest
