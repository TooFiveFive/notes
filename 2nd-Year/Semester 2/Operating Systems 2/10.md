## Virtual Memory
- When MMU checks present bit in page table, it know whether or not the page is in main memory or has been moved to the disk/not allocated

- Modified bit tells MMU that theres been an update to that page and changes must be written to memory/disk

- Blocks can be many different sizes. MMU decides the size of a block based on the requirements of the progam

## Free space management
- We can used ADT's such as hashes to check what blocks are available for allocation in logn

## Memory mapped files
- Files that are read into a buffer in main memory for modification. Locks are required for this
