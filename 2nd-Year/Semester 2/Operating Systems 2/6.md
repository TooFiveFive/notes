## Process Management in Linux
### Syscalls
- `fork()`: process creates a copy of itself
- `vfork()`: no copy

- `exit()`: process termination

- `nice()`: change priority of process

- `sched_setscheduler()`: if enough perms, change priority of process

- `alloc_pid()`: Checks if a pid is available and returns it. (removes it from the bitmap)

- `copy_process()`:

### Process states

Running, interuptable, uninterrbupable, stopped, traced, zombie, ready, exit

### Process creation
- Processes created by fork, vfork or clone.

- These call multiple syscalls (chained).

#### Fork
- CPU starts executing in kernel mode.

- Kernel performs a full copy of the memory/state of the parent process into a child process

#### Vfork
- No copy

- Child process will run within the memory space of parent process

#### Clone
- Provides similar functionality to fork but with finer control over the execution of the child process.

### Process concurrency
- If 2 or more processes (parent and child) are accessing the same file at the same time, we must provide locks.
    - Use `flock` to give a process a lock on the file

- Processes are put into active queue, then the core. Or if they are expired, they get put into the expired queue and wait to be active again

### Queueing
- Real time: FIFO

- Round Robbin: Keeps routine for the time slices of the processes and returns them to the source queue
