## Process Scheduling

### FCFS
- Running processes are put in queue and processed in first come first serve (FCFS)

### Non preemptive
- Perceived exec time: Turnaround Time / Average Turnaround Time

- Scheduling does not interrupt a process running CPU in middle of the execution. Even if it exceeds the CPU burst time

### Time Sharing
- Each processs wil get a designated amount of time to process before switching

### Priority Allocation
- Priority allocated to processes: Have a queue for each priority

- Based on priority, run the highest priority process ready to execute.

- After time given, return to a lower queue

- When no other process is ready, the idle process is run.
    - This switches the processs into power saving mode

- Priority Inversion happens when 2+ processes are in contention to be scheduled
    - This is solved in the scheduler by randomly boosting the priority of the process

### Real time Scheduler
- Scheduler preempts new process after event if it has a high priority.

- The schedulers selects process with earliest deadline
