## Memory management
- Different levels of cache hierarchy as they are closer to CPU/faster

- In order to replace cache and ensure that changes are written to non-volitile memory, cache has its own control unit

- The program addressable space is mapping virtual addresses to physical ones.

- This means you can use the same address space to get data from cache/ram/vram

- Memory allocation is required to contruct the program address space.
    - This can be done by malloc(all memory needed)
    - Or malloc(minimum memory required to start). Then malloc during execution.

### Getting physical address
1. Make process address space = virtual space
2. Add base reg and virtual address. (program memory start is base reg)

3. Use pages. (Since both physical and virtual space are organized of pages). Then malloc x amount of pages.

### Malloc
- During malloc, pages may be allocated 1 or 2 apart and this may cause gaps in main memory which may be too small to be used

- Solution: page tables

- In the table, the fields are
    1. Virtual page address
    2. Physical page address

- Acts like a lookup table for virtual pages to physical ones. Allows the kernel to move memory without processes knowledge

- The virtual address can use 10 bits or so as the page address. Rest can be used to index within the page.
