## Memory Allocation

### Ways of allocating memory
- First fit will succeed or fail

- Next fit will be the same
- Best fit
- Worst fit

### Buddy system
- Manages memory in power of two increments as static partition schemes are limited by a fixed number of active processes.

- It's achieved by dividing free address space size by 2 until it reaches the minimum block size for a process.

- EG: If i have 128KB of free space and 18 KB of memory required, divide by 2 until you hit the minimum which is 32KB

- Disadvantage is that this leads to internal fragmentation
