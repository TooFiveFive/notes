## 2-3 Trees
### Deleting
- Case 1: The deleted node has a 2-node as a parent + 2-node as sibling

- Case 2: Hole has 2-node parent and 3-node sibling
    - Move element in the middle up

- Case 3: Removing root node
    - Move up the right most in left subtree or visa versa. Then rebalance

## B Tree
- Every node can have m children
- Non leaf node with k children has k-1 keys.
