## Binary Trees
### Binary Heap
- Where every node has a lower key val than it's children

- Called a Full Heap

- To add, start at closest leaf node (less than) and ripple up until it hits a number less than the key. Then swap with the one before that.

- When removing minimum, Swap end of list with start (root node). Then ripple down (by swapping smallest with new root node).


```
left(i) = 2*i + 1
right(i) = 2*i + 2
parent(i) = (i-1) // 2
```
