## Memory
- Everything in python is an object.
- Variables point to memory addresses.
- `z=y` will give z the same pointer value as y.

## Lists
- Python lists are **array based**.
- Index references are stored contiguosly.
- Values are not stored contiguosly.
- Since it's an array, it just adds the index to the start memory address of the index array.

### Append
- Many appends require a **full copy**
- This is because lists indexes are stored contiguosly in memory so it needs to reserve more memory when size increases.
- Each time it grows outside a *log of 2*, it **doubles** in size.

## Tuple
- Sequence of references to objects.
- Immutable.
- More efficient but mainly implemented same as list.

## Sequence operations
- `if 4 in mylist:` Steps through each item in list
