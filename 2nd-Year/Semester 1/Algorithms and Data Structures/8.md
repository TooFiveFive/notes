## Linked Lists

### Implementing queue with singly linked list

- Front should be the first item in list as removale is efficient.

- Back (insertion) of the queue should be the last index.

### Efficiency
- Removal from middle of list?
    - We need to step through list from first *(O(n))*, then delete and link its surrounding entries. **Inefficient**.

## Doubly Linked List
- Adds last references to a singly linked list.

- All operations are O(1) since everything is referenced.

- Holds indexes to the first and last items.

### DLL Node
```
element: Object
next: DLLNode
last: DLLNode
```

### DLLList
```
head: DLLNode
tail: DllNode
```

- 5 operations to add an item mid-list
    - Add to last
    - Add to next
    - Add last to self
    - Add next to self
    - Add item to DLLNode

## Assignment
- Next week will include implementing a DLL
