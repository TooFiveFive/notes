\subsection*{Labs}
Fridays from 12 to 2
\subsection*{Definitions}
An \textbf{Algorithm} is a set of instructions which state how a task is to be performed
\newline
\newline
A \textbf{Data Structure} is a framework we use to represent data.
\newline
\newline
An \textbf{Abstract Data Structure} is a way of managing and organising Data Structures

\subsection*{Making an algorithm}
Ask these  questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does it do what its supposed to?
    \item How long will it take?
    \item How much memory will it need to run?
    \item How are we going to implement it? \textit{Shocker: python3}
\end{itemize}
\newline
\textbf{Programs} must be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Your program must be correct
        \textit{Not just bug free but does it exactly right}
    \item Your program must be effient
    \item Must be able to be human readable
    \item Do not subvert the design pattern
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understand wyas to interact with data
        \item Dont interact with data you're not supposed to
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
