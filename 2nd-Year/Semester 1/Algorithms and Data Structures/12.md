## AVL Tree
```py
self.root = None
self.size = 0
self.cursor = None
```
### Search Method
- Have a method to check if the item is in the node.

- If not, reset to root

- Have a method to check if a set is a subset of the set

- Keep going left until you hit end. Then do a right turn at the last turnoff etc

- Identify next item by going up left and checking if right child exists and is not seen already
