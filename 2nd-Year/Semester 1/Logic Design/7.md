## Karnaugh Map

- O notation: replace Irrelevant vars with *

### Minterm Example
```
A.¬B¬CD + ¬A¬BCD  = 
¬B¬CD vs ¬B¬C¬D
In o notation is *00*
```
### Examples
```
AB|
00|1
01|
11|
10|1 == ¬B
```

Difficult to handle with >2 variables
```
ABC|
000|
001|
---
011|
010|
---
110|
111|
101|
100|
```

### Karnaugh map example
```
 \CD
AB 00  01  11  10
00
01
11    |1|
10    |1|

B doesnt matter since it is both 1 and 0
C is always inverted
D same
A same
A¬CD
```

```
 \CD
AB 00  01  11  10
00    -------
01    |1   1|
11    |1   1|
10    -------

Since theres 2 groups, we know its 2 vars needed
A is both 1 and 0
C is both 1 and 0

Therefore
BD
```

```
 \CD
AB 00  01  11  10
00  --        --
01  1|        |1 
11  1|        |1
10  --        -- 

Nums on each side are 1 group

Since A is both 0 and 1
So is C

B¬D
```

```
 \CD
AB 00  01  11  10
00 1|         |1
01 --         --
11 --         --
10 1|         |1

This is a single block

A is both 1 and 0
C is both 1 and 0

Therefore
¬B¬D
```

```
 \CD
AB 00  01  11  10
00 1  |1   1|  1
01 1  -------  1
11 
10 

¬A.¬D + ABD
```

You can also overlap blocks if there's 3 in a row and treat them the same
