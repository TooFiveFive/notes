## Views
- Stored definition of a query

### Deleting Views
- `DROP VIEW <view>`

- Doesn't affect any results previously given.

- Any references to the view will no longer work.

### Updating Views
- Single table views are updatable

- Projection based views must include all fields of base relation to be updatable.

- Aggregate view are too abstract

## Stored Procedures
- Stored in the DBMS

### Example

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE 
GetAllProducts()
BEGIN
SELECT *  FROM products;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```
