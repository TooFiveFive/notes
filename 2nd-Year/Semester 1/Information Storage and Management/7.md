## Data Integrity
- COnstraints on SQL tables ensure data integrity

## Normailization
- A process of assigning attributes to entities

### Unnormalized Form
- If no primary key, use a combination of multiple keys as primary key

- Way of evaluating an ER diagram
### Example:
- Construction company
    - Building - number, employees
    - Employee - Number, Job
    - Company charges hours spent on each project. Employee is paid hourly too
    - A report is then **generated from the db**

## Redundancy
### Anomalies
- If the project number changes, change numbers in all tables

## Functional Dependencies
- `X -> Y => (ti[x] = tj[x] => ti[y] = tj[y])`

- This implies that ti implies tj.

- EG: A student ID implies a name

### First normal form
- Attribs must be atomic (no multiple values)

- Make a separate table for multi value attributes
