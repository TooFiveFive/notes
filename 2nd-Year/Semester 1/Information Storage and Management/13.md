## Triggers
- `AFTER UPDATE` is used to check after an insert as well.

### Reverting state
- A transaction hides multiple operations in single operation.
- If one of the operations fails in the transaction (eg: from a trigger), revert state to before transaction.

```sql
START TRANSACTION
    UPDATE PRODUCT
    SET PRICE = 100
COMMIT
```

### Concurrency
- Use transactions by loading each operation in the transaction after each other.

- When data is changed in one operation, run the other instance of the transactions operation.
