## In class test

- Only relational algebra

## Attribute Classification
- An atomic attribute is one that cant be split up

### Mulit valued attributes
- EG: Degrees. You can have more than one

- Represented: `BA, BS` etc

## ER Modelling 
- A physical model of the DB

- Draws relations in diamond shapes and enitities in rectangles

- If a line is single as opposed to double, this relationship is optional

### Cardinality 
- Number of entities an instance can be related to. **Constraint**.

### Many to many
- Entities can have N and M indicating many relationships

### Recursive Relationships
- EG: An employee may supervise another employee

- May be difficult to query

### Hierarchies
- EG: Marrying is a 1:1 relationship

- Therefore the cardinality of marrying will be 1:1
