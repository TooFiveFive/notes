## Joins
### Nested Loop Join
```
    For each tuple r in R:         
        For each tuple s in S:\newline
            If r and s join then output (r, s)
```
### Equi-Join
- A conditional join when a condition is 1 or 0
- The result schema is similar to cross-product, but only one copy of fields for 
which equality is specified

### Natural Join 
- Joins by common attributes

### Outer Join
- Outer join satisfies matching criteria. Also includes some or all tuples that **do no match criteria**.

#### Left Outer Join
- Operation allows keeping tuple in the left relation.
- If no matching tuple, result in **right relation is filled with null values**.
- SQL Syntax:
```sql
SELECT A.num, A.sqaure, B.cube1 FROM a LEFT JOIN LEFT JOIN B ON A.num = B.num;
```

#### Full Outer Joins
- All tuples from both relations are included in reult, regardless of matching condition.
- Not implemented in MySQL.
