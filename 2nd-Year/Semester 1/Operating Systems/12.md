## Data Hazards

### Load Use
- If used in immediate instruction, you need a bubble to stall the immediate instruction until the data is loaded.

### Memory Load 
- Check in ID stage for memory load instruction.

### How to stall pipeline
- Force control vals in ID/EX register to 0 (Rest dont operate)

- Prevent update if PC and IF/ID register.
    - Instruction is decoded again

- The Hazard Detection Unit Mux's between the control unit and 0 to stall.

### Branch Hazards
- Determining branching decision at the ID stage requires additional HW
    - This unit Takes in the ID/EX output of previous command.

    - It then Feeds in to the PC and the IF/ID

    - It creates a bubble during this stage and waits for the branch instruction

    - This then processes the predicted instruction during the ID stage whilst processing the branch instruction

### Data hazards for branching
- If a comparison reg is loaded by a 2nd preceding load instruction or preceding instruction, you need to stall the branch instruction (hence the branch predicting unit) for 2 clock cycles

- Dynamically, branches are indexed by recent branch instructions (branch history tabe)
    - To execute a branch, the outcome is predicted, start fetching the instructions
    - If wrong, flush the pipeline and flip prediction
