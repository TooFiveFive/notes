- Handles text easilt

- Sequence of patterns as regex

- Handles fields with fields with line patterns

- If you dont give it a patterns, it applies to all lines

- Interpreted

### Example:
```
BEGIN
{ total = 0 }
# initialise total to 0
/Fruit/ 
{printf "\n\n%s \t\tCost per fruit type\n\n", $0}
/Fruit/ 
{ next }
# skip file header, the first line .. Other ways possible
{ printf "%s \t\t\t %.2f\n", $0,$2*$3}
{ total += $2*$3 }
# END ensures actions are done after last record is read
END     
{ printf "\n\t\t\t\t\t Total cost is \t$%.2f\n\n", total }
```

### Handling text
- `$0` is whole line.
- `$1`, etc.. is 1st word, etc
- `NF`: Num records processes
- `FNR`: Num records processed on current line

```
$2 > maxrate { maxrate = $2; maxemp = $1 }
END { print “highest hourly rate:”, maxrate, “for”, maxemp }
```

### Conditionals
```
NF > 0 # Print every line with > 1 field
length($0) > 80 Make sure they have at least 80 characters
{ print NF, $0 }
```
