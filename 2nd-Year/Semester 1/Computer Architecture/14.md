## Dynamic Branch Prediction

- HW calculates the predicion using 2-bit prediction

## Speeeding up pipeline
### Deeper pipeline
- Less work per stage: shorter clock cycle.

#### MIPS DUAL ISSUE slots
- Slots issues into pipeline stages:
    - 1 ALU instruction
    - 1 Load/Store instruction

- Works but not when some dependencies are hard to eliminate

- Stalls to handle these slots dependencies can have high penalties with some programs

## Memory Organization
### SRAM
- More transistors per bit
### DRAM
- Keeps charge for few ms. Needs periodic refresh.
- DDR: Double Data Rate (What DIMMS are)

### Hierarichal Memory Organization
- Memory is organized from fast-> slow by:
    1. Registers
    2. Cache
    3. RAM
    4. SSD's (solid state memory)
    5. HDD's (virtual memory)

### Principal of Locality
- Programs access a small proportion of memory at any time.

- Temporal locality: Loop etc overwrite memory written in previous iterations

### Performance

- Processor has to have the data in cache to process.

- This affects runtime

### Main memory
- Usually contians code and data of running programs. Stored in blocks (eg 4 words etc).

- Blocks have to be read in whole to the cache

- 16 bit address line
    - Block offset: 6 bit
