## Processor architecture
- Data is fed back in and added to the PC after the ALU is done with it 

- Adds 4 to PC after each instruction for next instruction

## Circuit Operation
- **Sequential** circuits process IO at clock edges (on clock edges)

- *Clock edge*: End of a particular end of pos/neg edge of a clock (binary)

- **Combinational** transforms data from one *state element* to another during clock cycles

## MIPS Datapath
- Identifies a connection between two logical units

- Representation of the wires going to different logic units

## R format read/write
- Activation line sent to read data from each reg

- Data line also passed in

- It outputs the data from the reg activated and also the data passed in

## Load/Store Instructions
- EG: `lw rs rt`
- Reads register operands

- Calculates address using 16-bit offset

- Load: Read memory and update register

## Branch Instructions
- Encoded in I format

- EG: `beq rs rt addr`

- Increments the PC by the address if condition is true. Uses the ALU to do so

## Jumps
- Same as branch but add's 00 to the instruction in the half adder as opposed to 4 as to not go to next instruction
