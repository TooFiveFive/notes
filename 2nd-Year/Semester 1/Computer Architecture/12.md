## Pipelined Control
- Control signals are derived from instruction

- Start with execution stage

### Design
- If a sequence has many dependencies, it may need to forward data.

- Forwarding implies reading ALU operands from a source other than the register file.

### When to forward
- Data hazards when 2nd next instruction, it has to be read from the memory write back.

- Or else it has to be forwarded from Exclusoing memory for next instruction

- If theres an overwrite of a register during the pipeline, forward the most recent value (In the execution memory stage)
