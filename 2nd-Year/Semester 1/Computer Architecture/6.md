## Fallacies
- Powerful instruction doesn't mean high performance
    - Compilers are good at making fast code from simple instructions

## Arithmetic for Computers
- **Overflow** - When theres not enough space

## Multiplication
- Can be calculated as addition of shifted versions of the multiplicand
- **HI**: Most significant 32 bits
- **LO**: least-significant 32 bits

## Division
- Subtract and shift right

## Floating point
- Represent non integer numbers

- Defined by *IEEE Std 754-1985*
