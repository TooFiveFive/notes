## Pipelining
### Bypassing

- Hardware connections that allow the use of data directly after it's made available

- Requires extra connections

- Can only forward after loading value. Hence have to wait for next clock cycle.

### Code scheduling
- Re-order instructions to avoid load result in next instruction.

- These loads are stalled until the data is created.

- 5 clock cycles for `lw`

### Control Hazards
- Branch prediction etc

#### Optimized store on branch
- Decide while decoding, not while executing.

- This requires additional hardware.

#### Branch Prediction
- Adopted due to stall penalty becoming too high. (Gets worse the longer the pipeline)

- Predict outcome.
    - Stall if outcome is wrong
    - Accuracy -> Performance

- Static Branch Prediction
    - EG: conditional loop
    - Predict backward branches taken
    - Predict forward branches not taken

- Dynamic Branch Prediction
    - HW measures branch behaviour (records history etc)
    - Assume future behaviour with this data

#### Delayed branch slot
- Process instruction after the branch instead of stall.

- Or else insert a bubble (stall)

- No need for complex speculation HW
