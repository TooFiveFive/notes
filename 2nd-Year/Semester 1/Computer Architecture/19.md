## Parallel processing (Client >> Cloud)
### Parallelism
- Pipelining

- Multi code processors

### Hardware

- Using multiple processors for sequential or concurrent tasks

### Flynn's taxonomy
- SISD: Single Instruction Stream Single thread

- SIMD Single Instruction Stream Multi thread

- MISD: Multi Single

- MIMID: Multi Multi

### Vector Processing
- Vectors: 1 dimensional arrays. Compared to single pieces of data in scalar processors.

- Represents and extension of SIMD

- Extends instruction set with:
```
lv: load vector
addv.d: add vectors of double
```

### Multithreading
- Threads can be programs/processes.

- Multi thread processes generally share same address space

- Stores PC and registers states

- **Course grain multithreading**: Switches on long stall

- **Fine graine**: Switches After each execution

- **Simultaneous**: Schedule from multiple threads. Within threads, deps handled by scheduling and renaming
