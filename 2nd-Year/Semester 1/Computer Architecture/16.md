## Memory Caching
- Is smaller or larger block sizes better?
    - Smaller is better since less data has to be loaded into the cache

## Cache writes
- Write hit:
    - Write through: Update both cache and next lower memory block
    - Write back: Only update slower memory level when the entire block is replaced

### Write through
- Slower since more writes

- Speed up using a *write buffer*. This stalls until the buffer is full.

### Write back
- Faster but less accurate.

- Wehn an updated block is chaged, add a dirty bit as a control bit to ensure block is valid.
    - Use this in addition to the memories own control bit.
