## Memory Management

### Principal of Locality
- Temporal: For loops and such to be overwritten.

- Spacial: Data that's used together is stored together.

### Address space (16-bit)
- First 6 bits: block offset
- Last 10: Block Size

### Memory
- Block size = `2**(block offset)`

- Cache size = `n*(bytes/block)`

### Cache misses
If cache misses:
- Stall CPU
- Read from memory

- Hit miss ratio: % of mem accesses with hit/miss
    - `ta = a*th + (1-a)*tm`

## Direct Maooed Memory Organization

### Which blocks are to be swapped out in cache?
- Every block has only one place it's mapped in cache.

- If the 2 bits of the address start with XX, then it can only be mapped to XX in cache

- These 2 bits are the Cache Block identifier

- Tag is the balance of the number in memory this block with this Cache Block Identifier is.

- Direct-mapped Cache block index is: `(the index of the block) % (block size)`
