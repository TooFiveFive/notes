## Instructions
Exammple: `f = (g+h) - (i+j)`

ASM:
```asm
add $i, $S0, $S1
add $j, $S1, $S2
etc
```

## Memory Operand

C:
```c
g = h + A[8]
```

ASM:
```asm
lw $t0, 32($s3)  # Load word into the dest register $t0. 
# s3: Base reg first item pointer in array is loaded. 32: byte offset from the start of the array

add $s1, $s2, $t0 # Add 
```

## MIPS I-format instructions
op | rs | rt | constant or address
--- | --- | --- | ---
16 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 16 bits

Allows for  *Imediate arithmetic load/store* instructions

## Signed extension
- **unsigned vals** are extended with 0s
- **signed vals** replicate sign bit to left

## Immediate Operands
- `addi $rt, $rs, imm`: Adds a register and a sign-extended immediate value and stores the result in a register *with overflow* 
- `addiu $rt, $rs, imm`: Adds a register and a sign-extended immediate value and stores the result in a register *without overflow*

## Zero Register

- MIPS `$zero` is the constant 0. It's **hardwired**.
- Uses: 
    - `add $t2, $s1, $zero`: No need for move instruction as adding zero.

## Large Constants
- Most are small

    - 16 bits etc
- Sometimes we use *32-bit* constants: `lui rt, constant` does:

    - Copies 16-bit constant to left 16 bits of `rt`.
    - Clears right 16 bits of `rt` to 0.
- `lui $at, 61`: Load first half into the temp register

- `ori $t0, $at, 2304`: Ors secont half with temp reg and puts into `$t0`

## Logical Operations
- Shift left: `sll`
- Shift right: `srl`
- Bitwise AND: `and, andi`
- Bitwise OR, `or, ori`
