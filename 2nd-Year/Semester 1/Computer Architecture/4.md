## Conditional Instructions
- `beq rs rt, L1`: `if rs == rt go to L1`

- `bne rs rt, L1`: `if rs != rt go to L1`


 op | rs | rt | instruct offset
--- | --- | --- | ---
6 | 5 | 5 | 16

- **Instruction offset** exists since instructions are 4 bytes

- Some branch *psuedoinstructions* assemble to more that one branch instructions

- `slt rd, rs, rt`: `if rs < rt, rd = 1 else rd = 0`

- `slti rt, rs, const`: `if rs < const, rt = 1 else rt = 0`

### Signed vs Unsigned
- Signed: `slt` `slti`

- Unsigned: `sltu`, `sltui`

### If statements compiled
C:
```c
if () {
    f = g+h;
} else {
    f = g-h;
}
```

MIPS:
```mips
bne $s3, $s4, Else # Check if not equal and and if not, jump to else
add $s0, $s1, $s2 # If equal, add them
j Exit # Then exist
Else: sub $s0, $s1, $s2 # Else subtract them
Exit:
```

## Unconditional Instructions
- `j L1`: Jumps to `L1`


op | instruction offset
