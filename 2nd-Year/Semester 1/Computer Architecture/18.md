## Optimising Statistical Library for cache
- When a function is called, call a generic method that scans for more/all features of data and cache them.

## Virtual Memory
- The physical address may be limited by installed memory or CPU.

- Extend memory into HDD. 

- Physical memory is used as cache for the virutal memory file.

- A virtual memory block is a page

- A miss is a page fault (then read from HDD into memory).

### Design
- Reference bit in page table to denote it has been loaded to memory.

- Use a virtual address to get a Virtual page number to get from page table.

- In the page table, if reference bit set, this is already loaded into cache (physical memory).

- If not, load from hard drive.

- This depends on replacement policy and assoicativity.

- Each program has its own page table
    - HW include a page table register (points to start of page)

- To read from memory, read from page table in physical memory to get actual address then read from memory again.

### Speeding Address Translating
- **TLB**: Translation Look-aside Buffer

- **PTE**: Page table entries. 

- A fast cache of PTEs within the CPU.

- This means part of the PTE is available in the TLB in the CPU.
