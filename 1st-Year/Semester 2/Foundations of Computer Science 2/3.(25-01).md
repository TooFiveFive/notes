## Writing Predicate Logic Statements
### Examples:
`¬∀x(european(x) → inWC2014(x))`: It's not true that being a European country implies they were in the world cup 2014.

`¬∃x(¬inWC2014(x) ∧ sameGroup(x, Spain))`: No country that was not in the world cup 2014 was in the same group as Spain

### Example of translation to logic

```
Let the domain be the set of all computers connected to the
campus network. Translate the following into logic, and then
rearrange it into an equivalent formula.
"There does not exist a computer which has no virus
protection and which is accredited by the Computer Centre."
```
→ `virusProtection(x)` is true if x has virus protection. `AccCs(x)` is true if x has access to the CS department.

→ `¬∃x(¬virusProtection(x) ∧ accCs(x))`


## Examples of not Well Formed Formulae
- `sameGroup(England ∧ Spain)` is not since we can't have connectives inside a predicate.
- `∀european(x)` is not since `∀` isn't acting on the predicate.

## Translating from English
- *Some students in UCC were born in County Kerry*: `∃x(uccStudent(x)∧bornIn(x,"Kerry"))`

- *Some students take both CS1105 and MG1002*: `∃x(takes(x,"CS1105")∧takes(x,"MG1002"))`

- *All students in 1st year CS have a CS email address and a UCC email address*: `∀x∈F→(csEmailAddress(x)∧uccEmailAddress(x))`
*F is all first year students in UCC*
