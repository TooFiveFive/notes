## Big O
`x^2+1` is *O(x^2)*
### Proof
- For some `k` there is a constant `C` so that when `x>k, x^2+1 =< C*x^2`
- therefore when x>0 it will be `O(x^2)`

`x^3+2x^2+2` isn't O(x^2).

### Proof
-  we have `x3+2x2+2 <= Cx2`
-  we must have `x+2+2/x2 <= C`
- The only thing we could have got wrong is the assumption
that `x3+2x2+2` is O(x2). Therefore, `x3+2x2+2` is not O(x2).
