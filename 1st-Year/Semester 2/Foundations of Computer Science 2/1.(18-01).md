## Relations and Predicates
- A **predicate** is representing and solving problems with trees and graphs. They are relations acting on elements of sets. Eg. *inWC2015 is a subset of C*

- **Quantifiers** say how many elements must satisy a relation

### Using predicates with connectives
- We can combine predicates to talk about cross products of sets, etc.
## Summary
We can now:
- Use sets of elements
- See Cross products
- See relations over sets
- See whether or not a tuple of elements satisfies a relation.

These can be used to create propositions
