## Algorithm Analysis

### The Sum Rule
#### The Rule
- If I have to select an object from n non-overlapping sets, I have `|S1| + |S2| +...+ |Sn|` possible selections.

#### How it Works

1. Complete all actions for each set.

2. Assume each action takes 1 second in this case.

3. That means the task will take `|S1| + |S2| +...+ |Sn|` seconds

### The Product Rule

- Seleting an object from *n* sets and on from *m* sets will make *n\*m* possible combined selections
