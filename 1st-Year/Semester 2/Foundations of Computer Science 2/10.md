## Travelling Salesman

- 6 possible routes

- Use `3!` as there is 3 possible towns for first selection. This gives all possible solutions.

- Example q:
    ```
    Given a set of cities, and a table showing the distance
    between any pair of cities, find the shortest route around the
    cities which does not visit any city twice (except the starting
    point). In other words, find the permutation which gives the
    shortest distance (or find the cheapest Hamiltonian Circuit).
    ```
