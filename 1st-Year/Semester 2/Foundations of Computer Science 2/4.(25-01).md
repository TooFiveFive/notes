## Multiple Quantifiers
### Scope
```
∀x (P(x) → ∃y Q(y)) 
    |      |      |
    |      -------|
    |         |   |
    |  Scope of Y |
    ---------------
           |
       Scope of X
```

### Bindings and free variables
- A var is bound if it's inside the scope of either `∀x` or `∃x` (so it is quantified).

### Logically equivalent formulae
- Two formulae are logically equivalent if and only if they have the same truth value regardless of what
interpretation we give to the predicate symbols, or what
domains we specify for the variables.

### Examples:
- `∀x ∃y younger(x,y)`: For each student we know that a student exists who is older or the same age as x.
- `∃x ∀y younger(x,y)`: There exists a student who is younger than all other students.

### Quantifier Order vs Variable order in the predicate 
- Order of quantifiers **doesn't have to match** order of predicates.
- For example: `∃y ∀x P(x,y)`.

### Examples
- `∃x ∀y (notequal(x,y) → ¬sameTown(x,y))`:
If at least one x and all y are not equal, that x and y don't live in the same town
