## The Universal Quantifier

**_∀_** is used to show that a predicate is true **for all possible assignments of values and its variables**. This is called the **Universal Quantifier**.

### The truth value of the universal quantifier
- This means *∀x P(x)* is true for all assignments if *x, P(x)* **is true**.
- If all assignments of *x, P(x)* is **not true**, *∀x P(x)* is not true.

## The existential quantifier
- This means that the predicate is true for at least one assignments
- Symbol: **∃**

### The truth value of the existential quantifier
- This means *∃xP(x)* is true for one or more assignments if for *x, P(x)* is true.
- If assignments of *∃xP(x)* is **not true for one or more assignments**, if for *x, P(x)* is not true.

## Examples
```
Let P(x) be "x > 0" and let Q(x) be "2*x > 0", where U=Z

Answer:
Wff: ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)) 
    for all integers, if x > 0, then 2*x > 0.
```

## Two Equivalences

`¬∃ x P(x) ≡ ∀x¬P(x)` is the same as: *If there not is an x that makes P(x) true, every x will not make P(x) true*.

The reverse of this is: `¬∀xP(x) ≡ ∃x¬P(x)`.
