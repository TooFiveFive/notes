## Circuits and Graphs

- A circuit is a path that starts and ends on the same vertex.

### Euler Circuits

- A circuit is Eulerian if it contains every edge in the graph exactly once.

### Hamiltonian Circuits

- A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that contains every vertex in the graph exactly once.

### Adjacency list representation

- Make a list that contains all other vertices to which it's linked.

### Table Representation

- Have an `nxn` table for a graph with `n` vertices.

- Each cell contains a "T" or a "1" if there is an edge between the corresponding vertices.

### Isomorphic graphs

- Graphs are isomorhic **if and only if** there is a bijective function `g: V1â†’V2` if between `vi` and `vj`, there's an edge and between `g(vi)` and `g(vj)` there's an edge.

### Subgraphs

- Subgraphs are subsets of the edges of the supergraph
