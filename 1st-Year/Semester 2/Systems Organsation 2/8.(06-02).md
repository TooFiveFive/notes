## HDD Speed
- **Seek time** - Moving head to track

- **Latency** - Data rotate under head
- **Access time** = **Seek** + **Latency**
- **Transfer rate** - `T = b/rN`
    - **T**ransfer rate
    - **B**ytes
    - **N**um of bytes per track
    - **R**pm

### Total Average Access Time
- `Ta = Ts + 1/2r + T`
    - `Ts` = average seek time

### Timing of Disk I/O
- The I/O device will be busy during the seeking/reading sequence.
- If an error occurs during this time, it's called an interupt.

## The ISA Instruction Set
### Arithmetic
- *ADD* contents of reg
- *Increment/Decrement*
### Logical
- *OR* contents of reg
### Branch Instruction
- *Conditional* Instructions
