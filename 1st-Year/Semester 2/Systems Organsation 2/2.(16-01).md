## Contemporary Multilevel Machines Part 2
- Assembly language lies on top of the OS. This applies human readable commands which correspond to instructions in the instruction set.

- Architecture dictates what the components are and how they're put together

- Each level can be interpreted as a machine - abstract or physical.

## The **x86** Architecture
- Designed in 1976 to be backwards compatible with other instruction sets.

## The **Instruction Set Level**  
- The **_ISA_** includes:  
    - The instuction set
    - Addressing models
    - Native Datatypes
    - Registers
    - Registers
    - Memory Architecture
    - **Interrupt** & Exception Handling
    - External *I/O*

- The instructions are contained in a register which may point to other registers.

- It also dictates things like the largest memory address available since it includes the memory architecture.

    ### Interrupts
    - When the User uses the UI, a *callback function* is called which returns when the process is completed

    ### **The Instruction Se**t *(IS)*
    - This is the set of processor commands

    - This might include:
        - `ADD`
        - `COMPARE`
        - `IN`
        - `JUMP` - Goes to certain parts of a probram (Eg. *Loops*, *Conditional Statements*, etc.)
        - `JUMPIF`
        - `LOAD` - Taking a val from memory into a register
        - `OUT` - Putting a val through an I/O devices
        - `STORE` - Taking a val from memory into a register

    ### *_Example Instruction Sets_*

    1. **_x86_**
    2. **_8080_**  
        A 40 pin IC made in the 1970's.
