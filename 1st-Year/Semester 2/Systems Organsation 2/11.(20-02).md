## Addresses
- **Indirect** - `MOV [A0],AL` - copy to ram location `A0`. *This can also be acomplished by using a register's value*.

- **Calculated** - `MOV [CL + 5], AL` - Copy the val at `AL` to the reg location at `CL` + 5.

## More on Flags and Regs

- If reg `al` wasn't restricted between `C0` and `FF`, the program would overwrite itself.

- When the last computation results in a negative number, the *sign* and *overflow* flags are set. This is technically called **underflow**.

## Jumps

- The assembler calcs how far the `JMP here` is from the label `here`. It increments the PC to that location if the conditions are met.

- The conditions are set by the flags. For example:
    - `JZ` - Jump if zero flag is set.
    - `JS` - Jump if sign flag is set.
    - `JO` - Jump if overflow flag is set

- There are also negative versions of these instructions Eg: `JNO`.

### Labels

- Must end with `:` and not `::`
- No numbers or special chars allowed.

### Comparing

- `CMP` will set a flag depending on the comparison.

- This can then be used by the jump instruction as a conditional.

- Example:
    ```asm
    here:
    mov al,0a

    cmp 0b,al // zero flag is set
    jz here
    ```

### Ports

- `OUT 01` - Sending the value from `AL` to port 1.

- This will be used in samphire to output to traffic lights.
