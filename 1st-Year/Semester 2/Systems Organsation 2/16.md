## The OSM

### Processor Management
- Basic Tasks:
    - Ensure each process receives adequate resources.
    - Using as many cycles for real work as possible.

### Proccess / Thread
- A basic unit of work.

### General OSM

- **Interrupts** are signals sent by hardware / software to the CPU for its attention

- When an OS schedules process priority, **interrupts** can be *masked* (ignored)

- Some interrupts are *NMI*'s (Non-maskable). Must be dealt with immediately.

- Make users appear to have full control of the machine

- Switch between many processes many times a second.

### Keeping track of a process
- **An ID**: number
- **Pointers**: address
- Registers contents
- etc

### Threads
- **Asymmetric OS** - Uses one CPU for itself and shares others among processes

- **Symmetric OS** - Divides itself among various CPUs.

### Memory Management
- Proccess need to have enough memory to execute and not interfere with others.

### Memory blocks
- Loaded in chunks called *blocks* (2 kB each).

### Virual Memory Management
- Disk serves as virtual RAM under the control of the OS. 
- It can be in a seperate partition or a file. (**SWAP**)

### Device Management
- **Drivers** connect hardware to the OS.

- They're *translators* between the signals from a piece of hardware and a high-level's of the OS.

- During *bootup*, OS loads relevant drivers by checking what's connected.

- **I/O** uses *queues and buffers* (in memory).
