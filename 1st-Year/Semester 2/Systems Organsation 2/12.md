## Delays
- Delays are implemented by incrementing a register and checking when it hits a certain value.

## Org
- Use the origin for the following code, starting at this address.

- Eg: `org 90`

- Default: `org 0`

## Call + Ret
- A `call` is a jump to a certain memory address.

- It also memorises where it came from by `push`ing the last point to the ***STACK***. 

- A `ret` then `pop`s the stack which returns it to its previous position.

- This is nested many times in modern programs.

## TLDR

- The stack can grow and overwrite memory for the program.

- **AVOID STACK OVERFLOWS**
