## Subprograms

- Aka: *Procedure*, *method* or *function*

- Example: A busy loop. One that increments a reg.

- A subprogram should be reusable.

## Stack

- The stack holds IP's for different places in memory.

- For each subroutine, it pushes to stack and pops it when each one returns.

## in

- `in 00` - take input from your keyboard to `AL` (the hallway).
