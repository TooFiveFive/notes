## Words and Work Alignment (*Technical Term*)
- A fixed size piece of data that's manpulated as a single unit by the instruction by the hardware of the processor.

- The number of bits in a word is the word length

- This reflects:
    - Register sizes
    - Max transfer between processor and memory
        - Data Bus size
        - Memory characteristics

### Trade-off
- Since we want to have a uniform number of bits for every *word*, one character will take up 32 bits on a 32 bit machine.

### Solution 1
- Hava a min size of 1 byte and encode data as multiples of that.
- Both schemes have trade-offs, ultimately: **Speed VS Space**

## Endianness
- How the bytes of a word are stored in memory. There are 2 options: **Big / Little** Endian.

### Big Endian
- The **most significant byte** is stored at the lowest address and on.

### Little Endian
- The **least significant byte** is stored at the lowest address and on.
