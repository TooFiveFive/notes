## Sample Instructions
- `MVI r, data` - Byte 2 is moved to register `r`

- `ORA r` - OR register `r` with the accumulator

- `PUSH` - Manipulates the stack

- `IN p` - Take Byte in from port `p`

- `MOV r val` - Move `val` into register `r`

## Assembling
- After assembley, command is put into memory with the op code first and vals after it in memory.

- When the assembled code is ran, the op code is checked and the command is ran.

- The program counter then increments to the next op code.

## Labelling
- Using `JMP`, you can label segments of your assembley code using the following syntax:

    ```asm
    there:
    mov a1, 01

    jmp there
    ```

- During execution, the `JMP` OP code is followed by the amount to decrement the program counter by. This points the PC to the labelled code.

## *TLDR:*
- 20 is the ASCII code for blank

- If the result of any calculation is 0, the zero flag is set.

- Registers overflow back to 0.

## Introduction to Samphire
- It simulates the *8086*.

- 8 bit.

- 256 bytes of RAM.

### Status Register
- Theres report the CPU status

- Sample Flags:
    - `Z` = zero
    - `S` = sign (one calc gives negative result)
