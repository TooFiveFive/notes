## Memory Bank Organisation
### Read Access Sequence
1. Decode Row Address
2. Read Entire Row
3. Decode Column Address.
4. Select appropriate part of row

### How to speed that up
- **Problem**: A single, monolithic, memory array is slow to access

- **Goal**: Reduce latency and enable multi access in parallel.

- **Idea**: Divide the memory into multiple **banks** that can be accessed independently. - **Interleaving**/*Banking*
    - Each bank is smaller than entire memory storage
    - Access to each can be overlapped
