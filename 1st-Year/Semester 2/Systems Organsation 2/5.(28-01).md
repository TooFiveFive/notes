## Memory Bank Organisation
### Read Access Sequence
1. Decode Row Address
2. Read Entire Row
3. Decode Column Address.
4. Select appropriate part of row

### How to speed that up
- **Problem**: A single, monolithic, memory array is slow to access

- **Goal**: Reduce latency and enable multi access in parallel.

- **Idea**: Divide the memory into multiple **banks** that can be accessed independently. - **Interleaving**/*Banking*
    - Each bank is smaller than entire memory storage
    - Access to each can be overlapped
    
### Caching
- Memory usage is predicted and stored using cache.
- This speeds up accesd to values in memory

### Error checking
- Memory controllers check for errors on system startup.
- They have an extra bit which checks total number of bits.
- If total's odd, it'll be 1, or else 0.
- This is called an **Even parity scheme**.
