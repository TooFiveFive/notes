## Paging
- Virtual Memory is broken up into pages

- Range from 512 Bytes to 64 KB

- Every device doing this has a Memory Management Unit (**MMU**).

### Implementation

- The virtual page number is used as an index into the page table to find.

- All pages are in a *frame*.

- The MMU checks if the page is already in memory by looking at the **present/absent bit** in a paging table entry.
