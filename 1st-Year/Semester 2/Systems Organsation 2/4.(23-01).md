## Memory Architecture
- **Goal**:
**_Fast, Relaiable, Durable, Inexpensive Storage_**
- **Modern memory** is divided into **banks** up so that we can access them in parallel as opposed to sequentially.
### Hierarchy
- The speed hierarchy of memory goes from *processor regs* (fastest) to *hard drives and old tape drives* (slow)
- The lower the down memory types are in in the hierarchy, the less volatile they are. 
    - *HDDs can store data without power while cpu regs don't*

### Tech
### DRAM *cheap*:
- Stored vals are stored by a capacitor charged state.
- 1 bit stored needs:
    - 1 capacitor
    - 1 transistor (giving us access to that bit)
    - An enable row
    - A bitline (for retrieving)
### SRAM *expensive*:
- Two cross coupled inverteters used.
- Mainly used for cache
