## Architectures
- **Program Counter** - mem address of current program instruction.
- **Stack pointer** - holds address of next mem loc. It's decremented when data is pushed onto the stack as it points to the top.
### General Purpose Registers
- Can be used as either 8 or 16 bit registers
- The data can be incremented or decremented.
### ALU
- Contains
    - A 5 bit flag reg (*A* reg):
        `Zero, Carry, Sign, Parity, Avx Carry`
    - 8 bit accumulator (ACT)
    - 8 bit temp accumulator ()
    - 8 bit temp reg
### Instructions
- A byte containing an OP code is sent from RAM to the 8 bit instruction reg.
- THe contents of the reg are sent to the data buffer.
### Interfacing with a 8080 cpu
1. Control Bus - 
2. Data Bus
3. Address Bus
